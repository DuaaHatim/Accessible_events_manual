  <h1>Accessible Events Manual Summary</h1>
  <p>The Department of Culture and Tourism – Abu Dhabi (DCT Abu Dhabi) aims to promote Abu Dhabi as a global,
inclusive destination, attracting visitors from around the world with its rich culture, unique nature, diverse communities,
and distinctive leisure experiences.</p>
  <p>The Accessible Events Manual has been developed to improve overall accessibility in the events sector and position
Abu Dhabi as a regional and international destination of choice for travelers of determination. These guidelines
support the UAE Universal Design Code and Abu Dhabi Government’s People of Determination Strategy
(2024-2020).</p>
  <p>The Accessible Events Manual is one of the initiatives that falls under the Universal Access Pillar, one of the pillars of
the People of Determination Strategy, which ensures all facilities, experiences, services are inclusive for all.</p>
  <p>Abu Dhabi offers many unique experiences that should be inclusive for all, and this manual includes various standards
designed to ensure that the emirate will be renowned for its one-of-a-kind leisure experiences that appeal to all types
of visitors. Abu Dhabi hosts a wide array of different events throughout the year, and it is essential to consider the
needs and requirements of People of Determination to ensure these events are inclusive.</p>
  <p>The following manual has been developed with an ultimate objective to raise awareness of accessibility in the events
sector and to ensure that the needs of all individuals are addressed and facilitated at any type of event hosted and
organised in Abu Dhabi, particularly when it comes to physical access, customer service, and visitor experience.</p>
  <p>The accessibility standards in this manual are tailored for events and venues and were developed based on best
international practices for accessible events. These standards are structured around different categories and take into
consideration the different needs of People of Determination.</p>
  <p>There are a total of 188 standards with 81 mandatory standards and 107 recommended standards covering 16
categories: Transportation, Parking, Promotion and Booking, Venue, Outdoor Event Layout, Accessible Temporary
Structures, Accessible Viewing and Seating Area, Signage and Wayfinding, Accessible Bathroom Facilities, Food and
Beverage Area, Staff and Volunteers, Accessible Information for Visitors, Written Information, Visual Information,
Audio Information, Technology, Healthy and Safety, Emergency, and Additional Recommendations.</p>
  <p>The Accessible Events Manual is available to the public on DCT’s website under the Sustainability page and it has
been communicated with stakeholders that they have a one-year grace period until they implement the mandatory
standards listed in the manual.</p>
  <p>We look forward to ensure all events in Abu Dhabi achieve a high standardized level of accessibility and inclusivity to
ensure a seamless and safe experience for all visitors.</p>
  <p>This accessible version was created by the Blind Care Department at Zayed Higher Organization for People of Determination.</p>
